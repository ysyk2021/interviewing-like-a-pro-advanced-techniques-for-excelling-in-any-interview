Salary negotiations typically occur after the company has extended a job offer. Here are some key steps in the salary negotiation process:

1. Receive the job offer - The company will extend a written job offer that includes the salary and benefits package.
2. Research fair compensation - Research typical salaries for similar positions in your industry and region.
3. Consider your priorities - Determine what factors are most important to you, such as salary, benefits, or work-life balance.
4. Make a counteroffer - Based on your research and priorities, make a counteroffer that's reasonable and supported by data.
5. Continue negotiating - The company may make a counteroffer, and negotiations continue until both parties reach an agreement.
