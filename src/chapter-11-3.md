As technology continues to play a larger role in the job search process, it's important to understand how applicant tracking systems (ATS) work and how to navigate them effectively. In this chapter, we'll explore strategies for navigating ATS to increase your chances of getting noticed by potential employers.

Understanding Applicant Tracking Systems
----------------------------------------

Applicant tracking systems are software programs used by many companies to manage their recruitment process. These systems help employers sort through the large volume of resumes they receive and identify the most qualified candidates. Here are some things to keep in mind when navigating ATS:

* ATS scan for keywords - ATS scan resumes for specific keywords that match the job requirements. Make sure your resume includes relevant keywords from the job description.
* Formatting matters - ATS can have trouble reading resumes with complex formatting or graphics. Stick to a simple, clean format.
* Cover letters may not be read - Some ATS don't read cover letters. If you do submit a cover letter, make sure it adds value beyond what's in your resume.

Tailoring Your Resume for ATS

Tailoring your resume for ATS can increase your chances of getting noticed by potential employers. Here are some tips for tailoring your resume:

* Avoid images and graphics - Avoid using images or graphics that could confuse the ATS.

Making the Most of Online Applications

Making the most of online applications can help you get noticed by potential employers. Here are some tips for maximizing your online applications:

* Follow instructions carefully - Follow all instructions carefully when submitting your application to ensure that it is processed correctly.
* Use the correct format - Submit your resume in the correct format specified by the employer, such as .doc or .pdf.
* Double-check for errors - Double-check your application for errors before submitting it.
